Steps to implement after class certification Project.

These are just suggestions to implement the project, you can use your own steps to execute the Certification project as per document provided by edureka.

Steps that I suggest:

Create 3 Linux/Ubuntu AWS instances

Take 1 AWS instance and Install:

GIT , JAVA, Maven, Jenkins & Ansible.

making this machine as Ansible Controller Machine and Jenkins Master

Consider the other 2 AWS machines as your Ansible Slaves.

Steps to be executed in GIT:

Create a Repository with following files:

Playbook.yml
inventory file

*************************

Inventory files:
******************

Include private ip of both the Ansible slaves.

Steps for creating a playbook:
*****************************
Write tasks in plabook for:
Install docker on both slaves
Start docker service
Pull the image devopsedu/webapp given by edureka
Run the image to create container, do port mapping to access the application from web

If you want you can take the actaul code from git hub , build it using Jenkins(using ANT), create a docker file
build an image , pusg the image to Docker hub.


Steps in Jenkins:

Create new job with pipeline template.

Write code to create a piplelie with different stages:

stage one -> clone the repo form git
stage two -> Execute the playbook

click on pipeline syntax

Select step as ansible playbook :

Ansible tool : myansible  // will be there by default

Playbook file path in workspace : playbook1.yml    
// filename of playbookfrom git
		
Inventory file path in workspace: dev.inv

SSH connection credentials : 

click on add-->jenkins

select kind : SSH username with private key

id: private-key
Description: ansible
Username: ec2-user
privateKey :

go to downloads folder.. go to the host pem key which is gittoday
open it with notepad and copy the text

go to jenkins
click on add button and paste the text
  clcik on add key at bottom

now at SSH connection credentials : select ec2-user from drop down

Scroll down and check on 		
 	Disable the host SSH key check

Clcik on Generate pipeline script

Copy the code and as to your pipeline script.

Save and Build Now.

PART 2:

Once you run the application on the slaves 

Write selenium test cases for the deployed application and push the test cases in git repository.

Go to jenkins master , create a job and run your test cases using maven surefire plugin.

Thanks,
